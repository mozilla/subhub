## Secrets

Secrets in this project all reside in AWS Secrets Manager. There is one set of secrets for each
environment: prod, stage, qa, dev.  These secrets are loaded as environment variables via the
src/shared/secrets.py file and then generally used via the env loading mechanism in src/shared/cfg.py which
uses decouple to load them as fields.
