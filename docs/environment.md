# Environment

## Environment Configuration

The CFG object is for accessing values either from the `subhub/.env` file and|or superseded by env vars.

A value that is known to be set or have a default can be accessed:

```
CFG.SOME_VALUE
```

Otherwise the value can be accessed and given a default if it doesn't exist:

```
CFG("OTHER_VALUE", "SOME_DEFAULT")
```

These values can be enabled as an env var or listed in a `.env` in the subhub/ directory.
